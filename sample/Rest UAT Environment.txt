// The following are the steps that need to take place after refreshing the UAT environment from production:

//	Run script to delete the Dispatch Jobs, Field Techs, Service Providers (or use the truncate option) 

    // delete dispatch me objects
    DELETE [SELECT Id FROM dispconn__Job__c];
    DELETE [SELECT Id FROM dispconn__Field_Tech__c];
    DELETE [SELECT Id FROM dispconn__Service_Provider__c];

//  Reset flags on your objects that are used for Dispatch sync (e.g. Employee and Location objects). Sample script:

    // reset Dispatch me flag
    List<Location__c> lstRecordsToUpdate = new List<Location__c>();
    for (Location__c lst : [SELECT Id 
                     FROM Location__c
                     WHERE Dispatch_me__c = True]) 
    {
        Location__c o = new Location__c(Id=lst.Id, Dispatch_me__c=False);
        lstRecordsToUpdate.add(o); 
    }
    if(lstRecordsToUpdate.size() > 0) { 
        update lstRecordsToUpdate; 
    }    


    List<Employee__c> lstRecordsToUpdate = new List<Employee__c>();
    for (Employee__c lst : [SELECT Id 
                     FROM Employee__c
                     WHERE Dispatch_me__c = True]) 
    {
        Employee__c o = new Employee__c(Id=lst.Id, Dispatch_me__c=False);
        lstRecordsToUpdate.add(o); 
    }
    if(lstRecordsToUpdate.size() > 0) { 
        update lstRecordsToUpdate; 
    }

/* Go to Dispatch Global Custom Settings and delete all the entries:
    DISPATCH_API_CLIENT_ID
    DISPATCH_API_CLIENT_SECRET
    DISPATCH_API_PASSWORD
    DISPATCH_API_PROD_OR_SANDBOX
*/

//	Open up the Dispatch Settings tab and reset the values to point to the sandbox environment (copy other prod settings)
//	Go to Setup, search for “Sites”, click “Sites” link and send the Site URL to a Dispatch representative
//	Re-add dispatchme flag to locations you wish to enable (if relevant)
//	Re-add dispatchme flag to employees you wish to enable (if relevant)
//	Rename the Salesforce Org to have UAT in it (e.g. YourCompany UAT)
